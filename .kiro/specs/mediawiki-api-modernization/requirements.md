# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves modernizing the mediawiki.el package to work with the latest MediaWiki API standards and modern Emacs practices. The current implementation uses outdated HTTP handling, XML parsing, and authentication methods that need to be updated to ensure compatibility with current MediaWiki installations and provide a better user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a MediaWiki editor, I want the package to work reliably with modern MediaWiki installations, so that I can edit wiki pages without encountering API compatibility issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user attempts to connect to a MediaWiki site THEN the system SHALL use the current MediaWiki API format and endpoints
2. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL use JSON format instead of XML for better performance and compatibility
3. WHEN handling API responses THEN the system SHALL properly parse modern MediaWiki API response structures
4. WHEN encountering API errors THEN the system SHALL display meaningful error messages based on current MediaWiki error formats

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a MediaWiki editor, I want secure and modern authentication options, so that I can safely connect to wikis that use current security standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authenticating to a MediaWiki site THEN the system SHALL support modern authentication methods including OAuth where available
2. WHEN storing credentials THEN the system SHALL use Emacs auth-source library for secure credential storage
3. WHEN login tokens expire THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh authentication without user intervention
4. IF a site requires two-factor authentication THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate prompts and handling

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a MediaWiki editor, I want reliable page editing functionality, so that I can create and modify wiki content without data loss or corruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN retrieving page content THEN the system SHALL use the current MediaWiki API query format
2. WHEN saving page edits THEN the system SHALL use proper edit tokens and conflict detection
3. WHEN handling edit conflicts THEN the system SHALL provide clear options for resolution
4. WHEN saving fails THEN the system SHALL preserve the user's work and provide retry options

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a MediaWiki editor, I want responsive and efficient operations, so that I can work productively without long delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL use asynchronous operations to prevent blocking the Emacs interface
2. WHEN loading large pages THEN the system SHALL provide progress feedback to the user
3. WHEN multiple operations are queued THEN the system SHALL handle them efficiently without overwhelming the server
4. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate retry logic with exponential backoff

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a MediaWiki editor, I want comprehensive error handling and debugging capabilities, so that I can troubleshoot issues and get help when problems occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages with suggested solutions
2. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL log detailed information about API requests and responses
3. WHEN connection issues arise THEN the system SHALL distinguish between network, authentication, and server errors
4. WHEN rate limiting occurs THEN the system SHALL handle it gracefully and inform the user

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a MediaWiki editor, I want the package to leverage modern Emacs features, so that I can benefit from improved functionality and integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the package THEN the system SHALL be compatible with current Emacs versions (28.1+)
2. WHEN displaying information THEN the system SHALL use modern Emacs UI capabilities where appropriate
3. WHEN handling large operations THEN the system SHALL use Emacs threading capabilities if available
4. WHEN integrating with other packages THEN the system SHALL follow current Emacs package conventions
