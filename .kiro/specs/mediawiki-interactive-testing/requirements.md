# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines comprehensive ERT (Emacs Regression Testing) test coverage for the main interactive MediaWiki commands, specifically `mediawiki-site` and `mediawiki-open`. These are the primary entry points users interact with when using the MediaWiki package, and they need robust testing to ensure reliability across different scenarios and edge cases.

The testing framework will validate both the happy path scenarios and error conditions, ensuring that the interactive commands behave correctly with various site configurations, authentication states, and user inputs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a MediaWiki package developer, I want comprehensive ERT tests for the `mediawiki-site` command, so that I can ensure it works correctly across all supported scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `mediawiki-site` is called interactively without arguments THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to select from available sites using `mediawiki-prompt-for-site`
2. WHEN `mediawiki-site` is called with a valid site argument THEN the system SHALL set up the site and attempt login without prompting
3. WHEN `mediawiki-site` is called with an invalid site name THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and provide meaningful feedback
4. WHEN `mediawiki-site` successfully sets up a site THEN it SHALL open the default page (Main Page or configured first page) for that site
5. WHEN `mediawiki-site` is called and login fails THEN it SHALL handle authentication errors appropriately
6. WHEN `mediawiki-site` is called with a site that's already the current site THEN it SHALL skip unnecessary re-authentication
7. WHEN `mediawiki-site` is called and no sites are configured THEN it SHALL provide helpful guidance to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a MediaWiki package developer, I want comprehensive ERT tests for the `mediawiki-open` command, so that I can ensure page opening functionality works reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `mediawiki-open` is called interactively THEN the system SHALL prompt for a page name with appropriate completion
2. WHEN `mediawiki-open` is called with a valid page name THEN it SHALL open that page in a MediaWiki buffer
3. WHEN `mediawiki-open` is called with an empty or invalid page name THEN it SHALL display an appropriate error message
4. WHEN `mediawiki-open` is called and no site is selected THEN it SHALL prompt for site selection first
5. WHEN `mediawiki-open` is called with UI features enabled THEN it SHALL use enhanced completion with recent pages
6. WHEN `mediawiki-open` is called with UI features disabled THEN it SHALL fall back to basic string input
7. WHEN `mediawiki-open` successfully opens a page THEN it SHALL add the page to recent pages history
8. WHEN `mediawiki-open` is called and the page doesn't exist THEN it SHALL create a new buffer for editing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a MediaWiki package developer, I want ERT tests for the supporting functions used by the main commands, so that I can ensure the entire interaction flow is tested.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `mediawiki-prompt-for-site` is called THEN it SHALL provide completion from available sites in `mediawiki-site-alist`
2. WHEN `mediawiki-prompt-for-site` is called with a current site set THEN it SHALL show the current site as default
3. WHEN `mediawiki-do-login` is called with valid credentials THEN it SHALL authenticate successfully and set `mediawiki-site`
4. WHEN `mediawiki-do-login` is called with invalid credentials THEN it SHALL handle authentication failure gracefully
5. WHEN `mediawiki-edit` is called with valid parameters THEN it SHALL create or switch to the appropriate buffer
6. WHEN `mediawiki-edit` is called for an unauthenticated site THEN it SHALL trigger login automatically
7. WHEN `mediawiki-page-at-point` is called on a wiki link THEN it SHALL extract the correct page name

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a MediaWiki package developer, I want ERT tests that validate error handling and edge cases, so that the package behaves predictably under all conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any interactive command is called with network connectivity issues THEN it SHALL provide appropriate error messages
2. WHEN any interactive command is called with malformed site configurations THEN it SHALL validate and report configuration issues
3. WHEN any interactive command is called with insufficient permissions THEN it SHALL handle authorization errors gracefully
4. WHEN any interactive command is called during an ongoing operation THEN it SHALL handle concurrent operations appropriately
5. WHEN any interactive command is called with corrupted session state THEN it SHALL recover or prompt for re-authentication
6. WHEN any interactive command is called with missing dependencies THEN it SHALL provide clear guidance on requirements

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a MediaWiki package developer, I want ERT tests that validate integration with the modern UI enhancements, so that both legacy and modern code paths are tested.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN UI enhancements are available THEN interactive commands SHALL use enhanced completion and features
2. WHEN UI enhancements are not available THEN interactive commands SHALL fall back to basic functionality
3. WHEN `mediawiki-ui-select-site` is available THEN it SHALL be used for site selection
4. WHEN `mediawiki-ui-completing-read-page` is available THEN it SHALL be used for page completion
5. WHEN recent pages functionality is available THEN it SHALL be integrated into the completion system
6. WHEN progress tracking is available THEN long-running operations SHALL show progress feedback

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a MediaWiki package developer, I want ERT tests that can run in different Emacs environments, so that the package works reliably across different setups.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are run in a minimal Emacs environment THEN they SHALL pass without requiring additional packages
2. WHEN tests are run with different completion frameworks THEN they SHALL adapt appropriately
3. WHEN tests are run with different authentication configurations THEN they SHALL handle all supported auth methods
4. WHEN tests are run with different site configurations THEN they SHALL work with various MediaWiki setups
5. WHEN tests are run in batch mode THEN they SHALL not require interactive input
6. WHEN tests are run with debugging enabled THEN they SHALL provide detailed logging information

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a MediaWiki package developer, I want ERT tests that validate the complete user workflow, so that end-to-end functionality is verified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs the complete workflow from site selection to page editing THEN all steps SHALL work seamlessly
2. WHEN a user switches between different sites THEN the context SHALL be maintained correctly
3. WHEN a user opens multiple pages THEN each SHALL be handled independently
4. WHEN a user performs operations on pages THEN the history and state SHALL be tracked properly
5. WHEN a user encounters errors during the workflow THEN recovery options SHALL be available
6. WHEN a user uses keyboard shortcuts and menu items THEN they SHALL invoke the correct functions
